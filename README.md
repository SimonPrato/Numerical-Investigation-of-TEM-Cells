# Numerical Investigation of TEM Cells and Antenna Coupling (in Work)
This project investigates the coupling between magneto-electric short antennas and TEM cells. This is done by simulating them with Ansys HFSS, and deriving the electric and magnetic moments. Additionally, shielding materials and modes capable of propagation are looked into.
