# Numerical Investigation of TEM Cells and Antenna Coupling (in Work)
This project investigates the coupling between magneto-electric short antennas and TEM cells. This is done by simulating them with Ansys HFSS, and deriving the electric and magnetic moments. With this, shielding materials can be investigated.
