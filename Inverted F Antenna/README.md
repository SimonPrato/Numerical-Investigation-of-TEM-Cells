# Inverted F-Antenna

This folder contains simulation files of an inverted F-antenna on a PCB. 
- inverted_f_antenna.a3dcomp is the HFSS model of this antenna. It contains the antenna itself, the PCB and a modal lumped port.
- TEM_Cell_F_Antenna.aedt is a model of the TEM cell, with the antenna modelled inserted.

Furthermore, the gerber file and DXF file of the antenna can be found here. The work is based on the TI application report.
