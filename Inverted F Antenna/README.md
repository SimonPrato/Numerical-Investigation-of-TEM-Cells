# Inverted F-Antenna

This folder contains investigations of the inverted F-antenna on a PCB. In the *Ansys Simulation Files*: 
- inverted_f_antenna.a3dcomp is the HFSS model of this antenna. It contains the antenna itself, the PCB and a modal lumped port.
- TEM_Cell_F_Antenna.aedt is a model of the TEM cell, with the antenna modelled inserted.

Furthermore, the gerber file and DXF file of the antenna can be found in the *Gerber and DXF Files folder*. The work is based on the TI application report, which is here.
