# Inverted F-Antenna

This folder contains investigations of the inverted F-antenna on a PCB. In the *Ansys Simulation Files*: 
- inverted_f_antenna.a3dcomp is the HFSS model of this antenna. It contains the antenna itself, the PCB and a modal lumped port.
- inverted_f_antenna_short_signal.a3dcomp is the same, but with a shorter signal conductor. This fits better in the model of the TEM Cell.

Furthermore, the gerber file and DXF file of the antenna can be found in the *Gerber and DXF Files folder*. The work is based on the TI application report, which is here.
